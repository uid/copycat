For this problem we explore the differences between Java arrays and Python lists. Following the steps outlined below, test and implement the following method to check increment each integer in a Java array by 2. Hint: When comparing two integer arrays in JUnit, consider using the method assertArrayEquals(int[] expected, int[] actual).
